Hello Sui Foundation, we’d like to propose a proposal for unified assets.

## Present situation:

Currently users are using Wormhole to bridge assets into Sui, but the current situation is that from different chains to bridge to Sui, will become different assets. For example, for USDC:

  Ethernet ->Sui, get USDC.eth
  Solana → Sui, get USDC.sol
  Avalanche → Sui, get USDC.avax

## Disadvantages:

For users, it will be too painful and the assets will be fragmented. It is also very harmful for the project team and ecology, as there is a need to generate many different solutions for the same asset, which seriously slows down the Sui community.

## Solution:

Short term plan: It is best to have a unified wrapped Wormhole Asset
Medium term plan: Introduce more cross chain bridges.
Long term plan: intro native stable coin such as Circle , Tether

Cheers,
Mole team
